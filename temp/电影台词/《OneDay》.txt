改编自写过《恋爱学分》的英国作家大卫·尼克尔斯（David Nicholls）的最新同名畅销小说《一天》（One Day）。与发生在六十年代的《成长教育》一样，《一天》也带着强烈的时代背景。尽管剧情方面略显老套，但精致的配乐，以及在苏格兰、爱丁堡、伦敦和巴黎的外景拍摄，仍然被不少影迷视为亮点。这个浪漫喜剧故事的起点是1988年7月15日，一所大学为毕业生的狂热所充盈。籍着这股躁动，轻浮的德克斯特（吉姆·斯特吉斯 Jim Sturgess 饰）穿过层层人墙，寻找可以与之共度这最后狂欢与浪漫之夜的尤物。他将目光锁定在艾玛（安妮·海瑟薇 Anne Hathaway 饰）的身上，一个来自普 通工薪家庭的聪慧女孩。然而短短的交流过后，他们之间什么也没发生，却又注定改变了彼此的一生。在之后的岁月里，两人以友人知己的身份时聚时散，彼此分享着人生的苦辣酸甜和各种感悟。德克斯特经历着事业和婚姻的起落，艾玛品味着底层人生的辛酸。他们是远在天边心也紧紧相连的知己，是深锁心中最为笃真却相隔最远的爱恋……
任由岁月苍茫，汝心佳人常驻
I still love,but I just do not like you anymore. 我无法控制自己对你的难以忘怀,可我也不再对你满怀期待.
“I love you .Dex. so much. l just don't like you anymore” 〃我无法控制自己对你的难以忘怀， 但不再对你满怀期待〃
“也许……也许事实的确如此，那么，也许一切都过去了。” “过去了？什么过去了？” “我们。你和我。友谊。有些事我本该和你谈谈，德克斯，如果你还是我的朋友，我会那么去做。可惜我不会了。而如果不能推心置腹，那么你于我还有什么意义，咱们相互之间还有什么意义？” “……你这是什么意思？” “你也说过，人都在变，犯不着为此伤感。继续生活，另觅朋友。” “是啊，但我没说是我们。” “怎么说？” “因为我们是……我们。我们是德克斯和爱姆，不是吗？” 爱玛耸耸肩。“也许我们都成长了，疏离了。”
You feel a little bit lost right now about what to do with your life, a bit rudderless and oarless and aimless but that's okay that's alright because we're all meant to be like that at twenty-four. 你现在对生活感到有点迷茫，不知所措，没有目标，失去方向，不过没关系，我们二十四岁的时候都是这样。
遇见，只需一瞬 爱你，用尽一生
I want a child with the man I loved
我还妄想大展身手 到头来还不是默默无闻 I thought I'd make a difference,but no one knows I'm here
还有爱，只有爱，没有消失殆尽
I think reality is over-rated. 我觉得现实被高估了。
我爱你，很深很深，只是不再那么喜欢你了…
Whatever happens tomorrow, we've had today. And if we should bump into each other sometime in the future, well that's fine too. We'll be friends.
我想要的，不只是一夜，或是一天。
静观这所有的悲喜 都溶进灿烂星空里 感觉这一刻和千年本没有分别 一天就好像是短暂的一生 一生它只是无尽的路上 短暂的一天
「我爱你，我只是不再喜欢你了」
我想找个人说说话 不是找个人 就想和你说 It's just I need to speak to someone. Not someone. You
和她没关系，我只是不会为了做而做，而且，如果你事后想说的第一句话是‘别说出去’或者‘忘了发生过的事吧’我也不会去做。如果必须要偷偷摸摸的做一件事，那从一开始你就不该去做。
不要以灵魂知己的名义，去等不该等的人，去蹉跎不该蹉跎的青春。这个世界上，有些人，有些事，比爱情这种东西，更值得感动。
“你想过怎样的生活？”总有人用这样或那样的方式问她这个问题，没完没了。老师、父母、凌晨三时的朋友们。但它从未像现在这般迫切困扰着她，可她依旧迷茫。未来已在咫尺之遥，那些也许将是空空洞洞虚度的一天又一天，会愈来愈令人生畏，愈发不可知。她要如何去充实？
我无法控制自己对你的难以忘怀，但不再对你满怀期待。
本来想给你个惊喜，看来，适得其反
whatever happens tomorrow,we have today.
In fact, if I close my eyes,I can still see you there just standing in the dawn light. 只要我闭上眼睛，就仿佛还能看到你站在那里，沐浴着黎明的曙光。
有件事我以前从没想过，但是那事又在那等着、藏着。我以前也恨你，真心很恨的那种，Dexter 不 对不起 但是... 因为，她一想到你就高兴，是那种跟我一起从来没有过的高兴，这让我很愤怒，因为…我觉得你配不上她 可以这样说吗? -没事，继续说。 -她让你过得更好。反过来，你让她更开心，非常开心，我会一直为此感谢你的。
“是。二十二岁时就算生活一塌糊涂，你还可以说，反正我才二十二。二十五、二十八也将就。但‘我才三十四岁’怎么说得出口？”他呷了口酒，身子向后一仰藏进树篱。“每个人的生命里都有一个核心难题，我的那个是，在建立一份成熟、忠诚的真爱的同时，能否还维持一段三角恋。”
我遇见那么多人，可为什么偏偏是你，看起来最应该是过客的你，却在我心里占据这么重要的位子。
I love you, Dexter, so much. I just don't like you anymore.
我无法控制自己对你的难以忘怀，可是我对你的一切已经再也没有了期待
所有的事业都有起有落 这不过是个低谷而已 Every career has its ups and downs. This is just a bloody great down
他开始哭 默默的告诉自己：只不过是化学物质在作祟 化学物质化学物质。 他需要她 可是这世界上总是有这样的巧合 如果她知道 她一定会飞奔过去找他吧 可是没有 她不知道 她仍然在勉强着自己接受着另外一个人 没有人 会为你永远的留在原地等待！于她于他。为什么总是如此巧合的 要错过这种时刻 为什么 要有这么多遗憾。
多少人以友谊的名义，爱着一个人.
要是我知道如何戒掉你该有多好
你认为严酷、灰暗、沉闷才是生活的本色，同样也厌恨自己的工作、身处的地方，没有成就、没有钱都理所应当。你甚至在失落感和挫败感中寻求乐趣。失败和不开心对你而言更容易承受，你甚至苦中作乐。你对生活感到迷茫，没有方向，掌不住舵、划不动桨，不过不要紧，24岁就是这样
有的时候她会好奇，那个二十二岁的爱玛·莫利会怎么看待今天的爱玛·梅休？太过自我？太过软弱？为追求房产、海外旅游以及巴黎的服装和昂贵的发型而出卖了自己？还是太过平庸，因为改了姓氏，渴望家庭生活？也许是这样吧。那么二十二岁的她也不算个模范：自负、好炫耀、脾气臭、懒散、好为人师，自怜、自傲却不自信。而她一贯最需要的，便是自信。
我爱你,德克斯特,那么深,只是我不再喜欢你了。
一天，总有一天，会有一天的。 好久好久没有这样的感受。
有些日子里，你一觉醒来，诸事完美。 是啊，这样的日子多好。
“无论明天发生什么，我们都拥有今天。如果以后，某一天我们无意中相遇，那也没什么，我们会是朋友。”
冷嘲热讽多半是自我保护意识作祟。
这么多年，这么多人经过我的生活，可是为什么偏偏是你，看起来好像最应该是过客的你，在我心中占据了这么重的地位。 现在，就是此时此刻，我需要你，我需要感觉到你，我需要被你爱被你关怀。 我想要的，不只是一夜，或是一天。
我很孤独，但我并不孤单。
动心很容易，只要看到对方的美好，就能感受到心正在跃动；但爱一个人却很难，因为那代表所有他的好与不好，你都愿意包容与欣赏。 Affection is when you see someone’s strength, love is when you accept someone’s flaws. - One Day (2011)
这么多年，这么多人经过我的生活，可是为什么偏偏是你，看起来好像最应该是过客的你，在我心中占据了这么重的地位....
她一杯一杯地喝着咖啡，用她最好的钢笔在价格不菲的亚麻色笔记本上写下短小的观察笔记和故事构思。情绪偶尔变得恶劣时，她会怀疑自己对文字的热爱其实只是对文具的恋物癖在作祟。真正的作家，在废纸片、汽车票、牢房的墙上也一样文思如泉涌。而爱玛面对克重一百二十以下的纸张完全没有灵感。
的确很开心，别样的开心。所有的渴望、煎熬、热情，都被喜悦、满足以及偶尔气愤的沉稳脉动所取代，这是让人幸福的。如果说她之前的生活志得意满，那么现在的日子便是细水长流。
我一直在等海报中的画面出现，终于在影片的最后我看到了这一幕，只是，太心酸
现在，就是此时此刻，我需要你，我需要感觉到你，我需要被你爱被你关怀。
我以为我能忘记你
Ridiculous, at 38, to expect a song or book or film to change your life. 三十八岁了，要是还在指望用一首歌、一本书或一部电影改变人生，岂不荒唐！
Steven:?Except to say, that I think the best thing that you could do would be to try to live your life as if Emma was still here. Don't you? Dexter:?I don't know if I can Steven:?Of course you can. What do you think I've been doing for the past ten years?
Dexter:?Em, listen. If I could just give you one gift, alright? One gift for the rest of your life, do you know what I'd give you? Dexter:?Confidence. It's either that or a scented candle.
我爱你，Dexter，很深很深，我只是不再喜欢你了。（I love you,Dexer,so much. I just don't like you anymore.）
Dexter:?Em, listen. If I could just give you one gift, alright? One gift for the rest of your life, do you know what I'd give you? Dexter:?Confidence. It's either that or a scented candle.
我有那么多话想对你说，可你都不在身边。
我宁愿让自己站在风口浪尖，也不愿做个窝囊废，一年就挣几个钱。
Steven:?Except to say, that I think the best thing that you could do would be to try to live your life as if Emma was still here. Don't you? Dexter:?I don't know if I can Steven:?Of course you can. What do you think I've been doing for the past ten years?

Dexter, I love you so much. So, so much, and I probably always will. I just don't like you anymore. I'm sorry.
How many people in the name of friendship,but love a person ?
She began to understand the point of travel; she had never felt so far away from the launderette, the top deck of the night bus home, Till's box room. It was as if the air was somehow different here, not just how it tasted and smelt, but the element itself. In London the air was something you peered through
我想找个人说说话，不是找个人，就想和你说。
Ian:She made you decent, and in return you made her happy.
生活的痛泌出泪液。
Affection is when you see someone’s strength , love is when you accept someone’s flaws. 喜欢是看见一个人的优点，爱是接受一个人的缺点。
And I'm sorry for being so...boring. You're not that boring. I am, Dex. God, I swear, I bore myself. Well you don't bore me. You could never bore me. You're one in a million, Em. I'm not even one in three. Em? What? Just take it, will you? Just shut up and take it.
Steven: Except to say, that I thInk the best thIng that you could do would be to try to lIve your lIfe as If Emma was stIll here. don't you? Dexter: I don't know If I can Steven: Of course you can. What do you thInk I've been doIng for the past ten years?
Call me or I'll call you, but one of us will call, yes? What I mean is it's not a competition. You don't lose if you phone first.
我无法控制自己对你的难以忘怀，可是我对你的一切已经再也没有了期待。我爱你，可我不再喜欢你了。
如果你走了，我能至少假装你还在吗？
有何不可，他想，无论怎样，我身在罗马，今日晴好。我二十四岁，经济宽裕，身体健康。我有痛苦又渴望，正在做不该做的事，我非常走运。 有朝一日，沉湎于感官、欢悦和自我的生活多半会变得枯燥、消逝，然而在这之前还有充裕的行乐时间。
是一种自怜，为自己、为自己当时的处境、更为了自己一直以来的执着。或许我不该在看到那样的结局是悲伤的，因为毕竟在一定程度上那是印证了我的选择是正确的。可为什么我又很难受呢？因为觉得那样不值得吗？还是只是觉得人生总是很残酷，对该得到幸福的人总是很不那么公正？
你做的最好的事情！就是努力好好的生活！就好像TA还在一样！
What's this? My tattoo. From India. It's faded a bit. It's a yin-and-yang. Looks like a road sign. It means the perfect union of opposites. It means "end of national speed limit." It means put some socks on.
Dexter:?Em, listen. If I could just give you one gift, alright? One gift for the rest of your life, do you know what I'd give you? Dexter:?Confidence. It's either that or a scented candle.
Steven:?Except to say, that I think the best thing that you could do would be to try to live your life as if Emma was still here. Don't you? Dexter:?I don't know if I can Steven:?Of course you can. What do you think I've been doing for the past ten years?
一年一天，淡淡怀旧色调，场景瞬息万变中，时间就这样滑过指尖。一半友，一半情，用十几年来了然我爱你。人生中曾经拥有这样一份爱情的微光，已然足够。即便如此，最叫人念念不忘的还是得不到和已失去
I love you , so much ,just don't like you anymore. 我仍然爱着你，只是对你不再有任何期待。
我想遗憾大多都是因为差了那么一点点 也许是时间 也许是我爱你的方式天也许是那天我未曾开口 你未曾挽留 就此我们阴差阳错的再也未曾遇见 因为遗憾 所以我们仍旧挂念
我非常爱你，我只是不再喜欢你了，对不起。
He had always expected Emma to be there, a resource he can call upon at any time like the emergency services.

Dexter:?Em, listen. If I could just give you one gift, alright? One gift for the rest of your life, do you know what I'd give you? Dexter:?Confidence. It's either that or a scented candle.
The best thing that you could do would be to try to live your life as if Emma was still here.
偶尔德克斯特也会怀疑自己，担心因为才华欠缺而止步不前，不过，眼下最需要的是信心、精力，甚至是狂妄 这些特质在他的掌握之中。不错，聪明也不可或缺，不过不是爱玛式的聪明。只需精明、懂政治手段、有雄心。
when they feed on the souls of the innocent 当战争吞噬了无辜的灵魂 blood drenched pavement 当走在被鲜血染红的路面 keep on moving though the waters stay raging 当面对海啸的袭来 in this maze you can lose your way (your way) 面对这些时你会失去方向 it might drive you crazy but dont let it faze you no way (no way) 虽然这些可能会使你变得疯狂,但不要让这些影响你前进的方向

有朝一日，沉湎于感官、欢愉和自我的生活多半将变得枯槁，但在这之前我们仍有大把的行乐时间。
“你知道，你可能会让有些人觉得很怪异，中了魔咒似的沉湎于性交。也会有人认为这有点像绝望悲伤中的及时寻欢……” “有意思，我不觉得悲伤或绝望。”
我无法控制对你的难以忘怀，但关于你的一切我再没有期待。
所有同成长、老去相关的问题，我思考后得出的结论都是，我乐意维持眼下的状态。
我无法控制对你的难以忘怀 关于你的一切却再也没有了期待
你最终令我难以忘怀，可我却对你再无期待。

"Just kidding"was exactly what people wrote when they meant every word.
I don"t want your phone number,or letters or postcards. I don"t want to get married to you. Definitely don"t want to have your babies. Whatever happens tomorrow. We"ve had today.
I think you should head off to China or India or wherever and find yourself, and I'll get on quite happily with things here. I don't want to come with you, I don't want weekly postcards, I don't even want your phone number. I don't want to get married and have your babies either, or even have another fling.
I love you,I just don"t like you anymore.
Independent adult life, if she wasn't learning, what was she doing? how would she fill the days?The trick of it, she told herself, is to be courageous and bold and make a difference.Not change the world exactly, just a bit of around you.Go out there with your double-first, your passion and your new …
“我需要找人倾诉，不能是别人，必须是你。”
我爱你，德克斯特，很深很深。 我只是不再喜欢你了。
She always lit up and sparkled with you in a way she never did with me.
He's a better person when she's around, and isn't that what friends are for, to raise you up and keep you at your best? Emma is his talisman, his lucky charm.
即使一切无果而终，即使仅仅是端坐长谈，至少好过孤零零一个人过漫漫长夜。总之不要独自一人……
我很爱你，非常非常爱你，只是不喜欢你了

我需要找个人谈谈，不是别人，是你。what happens tomorrow,we have today.I will remember it forever.I need to talk to someone, not someone, you!

I love so much, but I just don't like you anyone. "我爱你，非常爱你，我只是不再喜欢你了。"
你认为，严酷、灰暗、沉闷才是生活的本色，同样也会去厌恨自己的工作、厌恨身处的地方，没有成就、没有钱、不交男朋友，这些都是理所应当。你甚至在失落感和挫败感中寻求乐趣，因为这种状态比较省力，对不对？失败和不开心对你而言更容易承受，因为你甚至可以苦中作乐。你对生活感到迷茫，没有方向，掌不住舵、划不动桨，不过不要紧，没关系，因为24岁就是这样的。其实，我们这一代人都是如此。
我爱你 非常爱你 我只是不再喜欢你了

他依旧闭着双眼，鼻孔里喷出烟雾。他显然知道自己正被盯着看，因为他刻意把一只手掖在另一侧腋窝下，隆起了胸肌和肱二头肌。这肌肉是怎么来的 显然不是运动练就的，除非把裸体泡浴和打台球也算作锻炼。这副好身板大约同股票证券和名贵家具一样，也承袭自他的家族。就是这样一位英俊甚至俊美的男人，在她四年大学时光结束之际，不知怎的就来到了她租住的小屋，躺在了她的单人床上，涡纹图案的拳击短裤还低低地扯到髋骨上。英俊！她寻思着，算了，你以为自己是谁啊，简·爱 老大不小了，清醒点儿，别被他弄得神魂颠倒。
